# Start the server (handled by the base image's entrypoint or command, 
# but we are executing this script, so we likely need to hand off control)

# OR we can just rely on the standard startup.

# For serversideup/php, the default CMD starts s6.
# We can just put our optimization commands here and then exec the CMD.
